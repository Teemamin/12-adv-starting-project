This project actually contains two projects:
- A React.js application (i.e., the frontend SPA)
- A dummy backend API to which the React app can "talk" (to send + fetch data)




The dummy backend API does not use any external database - instead the dummy data is saved to an "events.json" file inside the project folder.
